##### For desk secutity squad.

Here we need to create an Client Side API Client in the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/) .

After creating the client id, copy the credentials and use it in the page.

- There are some default values hard coded in the code, (it will work until the account was removed.)
- Multiple scopes can be added, just type some word related to it, auto compeltion has made.
- Dont use any spaces in between the scopes
- Onclicking the scope text box, you can access the previous history from the below select box  
- Generare the access token by submitting.
- ✨Click on the field of the access token to copy it.✨
